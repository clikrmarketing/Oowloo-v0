In today's fast-paced world, organizations in healthcare, education, and residential care face the challenge of ensuring the well-being of individuals under their care while maintaining operational efficiency. Oowloo emerges as a groundbreaking solution that transforms routine check-ins and oversight into a seamless and intelligent experience.


## What is Proactive Care Management?

A family budget is a plan for your household’s incoming and outgoing money over a certain period of time, such as a month or year. For example, you may aim for certain dollar amounts or percentages of monthly income to go toward various expenses, like groceries, as well as saving, investing, and paying off debt.

Many people simply spend their income without being intentional about it, but you get to decide how to allocate that money so that it works for you.
