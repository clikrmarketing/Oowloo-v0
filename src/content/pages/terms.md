## Web Site Terms of Use
Please read these Terms of Use (&quot;Terms&quot;) carefully before using the Halotree Inc. (&quot;Halotree&quot;)
web site (&quot;Site&quot;). By accessing or using the Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms. Terms
defined in our Privacy Policy have the same meaning here.

## Use of Content
The content on the Site—including information, artwork, text, video, audio, and images
(&quot;Content&quot;)—is protected by copyright laws. You may access and print Content for personal or
educational purposes only, provided all copyright notices are retained. You may not modify,
reproduce, republish, post, transmit, or distribute any Content without Halotree&#39;s express written
consent.

## User Obligations
You agree not to use the Site for any unlawful activities or to solicit the performance of any
activity prohibited by law or contractual obligations. You must comply with all applicable laws,
rules, and regulations while using the Site.

## Access and Interference
You agree not to use any automated means—such as robots or spiders—to access the Site
without Halotree&#39;s express written permission. You also agree not to interfere with the proper
functioning of the Site.

## Privacy Policy
Your use of the Site is subject to our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms by
reference.

## Links to Third-Party Sites
The Site may contain links to third-party websites for your convenience. Halotree does not
endorse or assume responsibility for the content or practices of these sites. Access them at your
own risk.

## Disclaimer of Warranties
Your use of the Site and Content is at your own risk. The Site and Content are provided &quot;as is&quot;
and &quot;as available,&quot; without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, or non-infringement.

## Limitation of Liability
Halotree and its affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
exemplary damages arising from your use of the Site or Content. Halotree&#39;s total liability to you
for all claims shall not exceed one dollar ($1.00). Some jurisdictions do not allow such
limitations, so they may not apply to you.

## Governing Law and Jurisdiction
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to its conflict of
law provisions. You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and
federal courts located in Atlanta, Georgia.

## Arbitration
Any disputes arising from these Terms shall be resolved through binding arbitration in
accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration will be conducted
on an individual basis, not as a class action. This does not prevent Halotree from seeking
injunctive relief to protect its intellectual property rights.

## General Terms
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Halotree regarding the Site. If any
provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect. You
may not assign these Terms without Halotree&#39;s prior written consent.
